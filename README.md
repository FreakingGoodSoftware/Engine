# Engine

## What?
Engine framework is a set of tools, guidance, knowledge base and repositories for developers working with Xamarin technologies and Microsoft related to create cross-platform mobile applications and solutions.

## Why?
We consider there are many references out there to build apps, from videos, to books and blogs, however it can be frustrating to search for the right information, the best and most reliable sources. 

Often you find outdated, static documentation and demos that lack the complexity of real world applications and won't evolve easily, all of these resources can be synthesized into a direct, dynamic and complete framework to help you build better applications and will evolve through the input from the community, the open source code and discussions on this readme.io site.

## How?
Engine will contain the best of the resources you love. While Engine is not another StackOverflow or CodeProject, neither a Plazi or Udemy, nor the reference book or site you have always with you, it will certainly from time to time reference content from these resources, that have been considered appropriate to incorporate into Engine, incorporating all code into an open source project we will attribute other people's work as we go. Sometimes we will fail to properly attribute authors, but we will be happy to include the attribution if anyone points it out.

## Who?
We are a group of developers passionate about technology and willing to provide knowledge and experience but also learn from great people related to our work, you finding this resource is a big step forward and we are looking forward to help you and learn from you. You can reach us if you have an inquiry, want some consulting or just spread the word. We are:
